    <h4 id="background">Background</h4>
    <p>
      The people working in the state, county, and tribal areas of CA are the
      people we entrust to respond to, protect, and maintain the safety, well
      being, and home permanency of CA&#39;s at risk children. At Child Welfare
      Digital Services (CWDS) we are redesigning the tools that help these case
      workers, social workers, home approval and licensing workers, and
      administrative staff who do this work. When we increase the time social
      workers and other professionals interact with the children in the child
      welfare system, it leads to better outcomes for children. We aim to do
      that by designing more efficient tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      CWS-CARES will replace multiple, disjointed state and county systems
      currently in use, including the statewide CWS/Case Management System that
      was created in 1997.{' '}
    </p>
    <h4 id="vision">Vision</h4>
    <p>We will design solutions that that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Meet user needs based on primary user research and feedback from county
        and tribal workers
      </li>
      <li>Address changing policy requirements</li>
      <li>Improve the quality of data entered into the system</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      CWS-CARES will be reliable, responsive, and intuitive to use. Workers will
      be able to better monitor the safety, well being and home permanency of
      children touched by the CA child welfare system.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      The design will encourage workers to identify and capture valuable
      information. It will allow both workers and policy makers to pull
      actionable insights from the data.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      The design will keep simple things simple and make complex things
      understandable.
    </p>
    <p>
      CWS-CARES will be one of the best child welfare decision-making tools in
      the nation. We will share the research insights that lead to our design
      decisions as well as resulting the principles, design system, and
      solutions. We invite other states to use and build on our work.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that government can build excellent user-centered digital
      services.
