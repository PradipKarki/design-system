import Badge from '@cwds/components/lib/Badge';

## Synopsis

Badges are cool

## Examples

Alerts should not be used for field level validation - see invalid fields for this.

### Typical

\asdfasdfasdf

<Badge>
  I am Badge!
</Badge>

Alerts should be placed at the top of a card or at the top of the page.

Error alerts should never be dismissible, so that a user always knows what they need to do to progress.

Use Error Alerts to denote when an error exists that prevents a user from progressing (Ex: internet offline, 500 error when submitting).

Warning, Info & Success alerts can be dismissible as it does not prevent a user from doing their work.

Use Warning Alerts for when something important occurs, but does not prevent a user from progressing (Ex: Medium risk or safety levels)

Use Info Alerts for giving users a heads up about something new or a change (Ex: new feature, notification)

Use Success Alerts for positive reinforcement after completing a task (Example: screening successfully created, form 100% complete)
